This is the content management system created for three purposes:

  * To power my own site, drakej.ca,
  * To replace the static site on uwinsocr.ca,
  * For a web development class (60-334).

The version as of Thursday, May 15th 2014, is simply a front end
controller. It uses composer, but not actively yet.

To update composer,

> php composer.phar update
> php composer.phar install

It will update what is under the vendor directory.
